### Abstract
During the last decades, Islamic banking has become a major influence for worldwide banking, which led to conventional banks using their existing infrastructure and branches to provide Islamic banking services. Despite the growing impact of this new type of bank, referred to as dual bank, including conventional and Islamic banking services, only a few authors have marginally analyzed them, none of them in a merger and acquisition (M&A) context. This study examines a global strategic fit of 375 bank M&As in 39 nations between 2011 and 2020. An input-oriented, two-stage network DEA (Data Envelopment Analysis) approach is used, computing several efficiency scores of the merged banks. Merging in our analysis involves a virtual combination of inputs and outputs of pairs of separate banks to test the efficiencies of this virtually merged entity. The findings reveal that the bank type impacts the virtual efficiency: dual bank M&As show a large advantage over conventional bank M&As.

## Culture of the Mexican Army

### Abstract
This scholarship provides a descriptive analysis of the professionalization and culture of the Mexican military, focusing on how two pivotal events—the War of Independence (1810–1821) and the Revolution (1910–1920)—shaped its modern values and traditions. It traces the military’s transformation from a politically interventionist force in the 19th century to a professionalized institution with limited political involvement today, framed within the broader Iberian military tradition. The paper highlights how distinct political and social dynamics influenced the professionalization of Mexico compared to Brazil and Peru, despite their shared heritage. Key reforms, such as the Organic Law of 1926, illustrate the Mexican military’s evolving role in civic duties, disaster relief, and public emergencies, with a deliberate detachment from political affairs. Recent developments, including anti-drug operations and the creation of the National Guard are examined as part of an ongoing cultural shift. Ultimately, the study underscores the enduring influence of the Iberian military tradition on Latin American military institutions.
